# Logical Operation

## AIM:

To Perform logical operation using Arduino UNO Controller.

## Software required:

Arduino IDE </br>
Proteous 

## PROCEDURE:
### Arduino IDE
Step1:Open the Arduino IDE </br>
Step2: Go to file and select new file option</br>
Step3:
Type the program
# Step4
Go to file and select save option to save the program
# Step5
Go to sketch and select verify or compile options.
# Step6
If no error Hex file will be generated in the temporary folder
# Proteus 
# Step7
Open the Proteus software
# Step8
Go to file select new design and click ok button.
# Step9
Select component mode and click pick devices from the library. 
# Step10
Type the component name in the keyword to select the components and click ok button.
# Step11
Design the circuit as per the diagram
# Step12
Double click the Arduino controller and upload the hex file generated by Arduino IDE
# Step13
Click start button and check the output 
## THEORY:

## AND GATE

## XOR GATE

## 4:1 MULTIPLXER

## PROGRAM:

## CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:

## OUTPUT:

## RESULT:

Thus the logical operation was performed by Arduino UNO controller
